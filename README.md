# SenHat - A sensor-equipped cap for the visually impaired.

This project uses sensors and other components from the Sunfounder Sensor Kit V2 for the Raspberry Pi mounted on a cap. The Raspberry Pi, situated in a fanny pack (bumbag) and powered by a battery, is connected to these sensors using GPIO pins and jumper wire extenders.

`main.py` **contains the necessary code to create a warning system that warns the visually impaired user about objects that are too close, and allows them to discern the color of an object by using the RGB sensor.**
