# SenHat - A sensor-equipped cap for the visually impaired.

This project uses sensors and other components from the Sunfounder Sensor Kit V2 for the Raspberry Pi mounted on a cap. The Raspberry Pi, situated in a fanny pack (bumbag) and powered by a battery, is connected to these sensors using GPIO pins and jumper wire extenders.
